# Welcome to Picozi :smiley:

## _A Simple Yet Powerful Image Processing App_ :star:

#### Picozi is an AI-enabled application that uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning to compute images and perform several processing tasks automatically. 
  
The Project is still under development.

## Features :point_down:

-  **Upload an Image and apply simple filters to enhance the image.**

-  **Perform basic face components detection like Face, Smile, and Eye.**

- **Simple image processing options to perform basics tasks.**

-  **Image Segmentation to segment multiple objects inside an image.**

-  **Color Quantization with different K-values.**

-  **More features coming soon.....................**


## Tech Stack

**Picozi** uses following :point_down:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) üêç - _De facto_ Language!!
- [Open CV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) - Open-Source library for computer vision.
- [Pixel Lib](https://pypi.org/project/pixellib/) - Object segmentation to perform excellent foreground and background separation.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning in Python.
- Streamlit - Streamlit is LOVE :hearts:
